    <p>
      Ibus-table is an input method framework for table-based input
      methods.  Mostly it is used for Chinese input methods such as
      ZhengMa, WuBi, ErBi, CangJie, ….  But some tables for other
      languages are available as well.

          working normally if any such serious problem with playing
          sounds occurs. Without sound of course but it should not

          github-ibus-issue#2241: Make key bindings configurable.

          Only via the command line for the moment, not yet easy to do
          for normal users. I have to rewrite the setup tool
          eventually to make that possible.

          This rewrite of the handling of the key bindings also fixes
          the problem reported in github-ibus-issue#2241 that the
          Shift_L key cannot switch between Chinese and English mode
          when using google-chrome.
